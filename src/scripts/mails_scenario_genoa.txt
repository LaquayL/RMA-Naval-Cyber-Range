Radar Calibration & Range Setting

Radar operator,

Outbound corridor is narrow. Perform the following immediately after being at least 3NM from the coast :
1) Check Radar Navico and raise range to 12 NM, then lower back to 6 NM.
2) Check Radar Asterix once Navico has cycled, adapt Asterix range to 6NM.
3) Adapt gain on Asterix radar to avoid excessive clutter.

Reply with screenshots of both radars’ PPI displays correctly configured.

AIS & Position Cross-Check

WECDIS operator,

With heavy traffic south of our track, maintain collision avoidance vigil.
Please complete the following tasks:
1) Check position of nearby ships.
2) Send me your current coordinates.
3) Send me the coordinates and AIS code of the nearest vessel.

Engine & Steering-Gear Systems Check

Engine operator,

Technicians have noticed latent rudder responses, a check of the steering-gear system is required.
Please complete the following tasks:
1) Check temperature of the steering-gear system pump 1
2) Check pressure of the steering-gear system pump 1
3) Check RPM of steering-gear system pump 1

Reply with your three readings (RPM, temperature and pressure of pump 1) and pump-flow status.

For the rest of the navigation, if the temperature of pump 1 rise above 62°, activate pump 2. When back to normal temperature of around 50° for both pumps, deactivate pump 2 to go back to normal operation mode.

URGENT: Updated Tide Predictions for Genoa Passage

Radar operator,

Harbour Operations have just posted a revised tide forecast for today’s run past the Western Breakwater.
To maintain optimum steerage and engine thrust scheduling, please:
1) Consult this website https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Genova/tides/latest to view the latest high-tide and low-tide times at Genoa’s Western Breakwater.
2) Report back the next high-water time and its predicted height.

Respond within 10 minutes so we can issue updated engine orders before we enter the narrow corridor.

IMMEDIATE ACTION: SYSTEM RESTORATION & MALWARE ERADICATION

All stations,

The recent DOS on both radars and the spoofed WECDIS contacts have been confirmed as hostile cyber intrusions.
We must regain full sensor and navigation fidelity before the flood tide slackens (in 45 minutes).
Failure to restore systems promptly risks navigational error in the narrow corridor and jeopardizes the entire convoy schedule.

You have 30 minutes to:
1) Identify the root cause of the disruptions on your systems.
2) Disable the cause of the disruption to get back clear radar signal and correct WECDIS positioning.
3) Locate and delete permanently all unauthorized executables, scripts, or registry entries installed during the attack.
4) Confirm systems sanity by testing the proper functioning of the radar and WECDIS features.

Immediately upon task closure, report completion of each step and any unresolved anomalies on the systems.

Approach & Anchoring Preparations

Engine operator,

You are now at the entry to Genoa’s western anchorage.

Do not set engine power above 50% and reduce speed below 5 knots.

Reply with “Engine ready” once complete.

Radar Sector Scan & Range Setting

Radar operator,

Prior to anchoring, perform the following tasks:
1) Set Navico radar range to 3 NM; Then Asterix to 3 NM.
2) Adjust Asterix gain to 1.1 for close-in contacts.

Send PPI screenshot and “Radar clear” once complete.
